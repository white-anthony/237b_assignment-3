# Tiled Matrix Multiplication
## Objective
Implement a tiled dense matrix multiplication routine using shared memory.

## Instructions
Edit the code in the code tab to perform the following:

* Allocate device memory
* Copy host memory to device
* Initialize work group dimensions
* Invoke OpenCL kernel
* Copy results from device to host
* Deallocate device memory
* Implement the matrix-matrix multiplication routine using shared memory and tiling

Recommended Block dimensions are $16 \times 16$.

## Files and Directories

* `Makefile`: Automates the compilation and execution process for the project.
* `main.c`: Source code for the tiled matrix multiplication using OpenCL.
* `kernel.cl`: OpenCL kernel file for performing tiled matrix multiplication.

## How to Compile
The `main.c`, `kernel.cl` files contains the code for the programming assignment. There is a Makefile included which compiles it and links it with the `helper_lib` library automatically. It can be run by typing make from the `opencl_tiled_mm` folder. It generates a `solution` output file.

## How to Test
Use the make run command to test your program. here are a total of 9 tests on which your program will be evaluated for (functional) correctness. Since PA3 and PA4 are functionally the same, we will use the last test case to verify if your programs meet the speedup requirements that you should get using shared memory.

## Submission
Submit the GitHub repo to Gradescope.

## Further Documentation
`float allocateMatrix(int rows, int cols)`:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocates memory for a 2D matrix with the given number of rows and columns. Returns a pointer to the allocated matrix.

`void generateRandomMatrix(float matrix, int rows, int cols)`:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills a given matrix with random float values. Each element in the matrix is assigned a random float value between 0 and 1.

`float multiplyMatrices(float** A, int A_rows, int A_cols, float** B, int B_cols)`:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiplies two matrices $A$ and $B$. $A$ has dimensions $A_{rows} \times A_{cols}$ and $B$ has dimensions $A_{cols} \times B_{cols}$. Returns a new matrix $C$ that is the product of $A$ and $B$ with dimensions $A_{rows} \times B_{cols}$.

`void saveMatrixToFile(const char* filename, float matrix, int rows, int cols)`:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saves a given matrix to a file specified by filename. The matrix is written to the file with each element separated by a space and each row on a new line.

`**int main(int argc, char* argv[])`:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry point of the program. Expects three command-line arguments representing the dimensions of the matrices: $A$ (rows of matrix1), $B$ (columns of matrix1 and rows of matrix2), and $C$ (columns of matrix2). Allocates and generates two random matrices of sizes $A \times B$ and $B \times C$. Multiplies these matrices and saves the result in three files: `A.txt`, `B.txt`, and `C.txt`. Frees the allocated memory for all matrices before exiting.
